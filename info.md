## Description

Our project is based on the Kaggle Competition Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction.

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.
 
RStudio, the developer of free and open tools for R and enterprise-ready products for teams to scale and share work, has partnered with Google Cloud and Kaggle to demonstrate the business impact that thorough data analysis can have.
 
In this competition, we will analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data
